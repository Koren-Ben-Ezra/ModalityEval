    # image_to_text_pipe = pipeline(
    #     "image-to-text",
    #     model=model_name,
    #     trust_remote_code=True,

        "image-to-text",
        model=model_name,
        device_map="auto"     # Requires 'accelerate' or 'bitsandbytes' installed for large models
    )

    # Load the image using PIL
    image_path = "my_image.jpg"  # Replace with your image
    image = Image.open(image_path)
    
    # Provide the image and optionally a prompt
    prompt = "Describe the image in detail."
    
    # The pipeline call can take either a dict or just the image directly,
    # depending on how the modelâ€™s forward is implemented.
    # The simplest approach is just to call:
    result = image_to_text_pipe(image, prompt=prompt)
